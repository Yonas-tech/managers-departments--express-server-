# managers-departments--express-server-
In this project I created a ExpressJs server. I used ExpressJs JSX view engine, jsx-view-engine, to render react components on the server. 

Here is the structure of the server: 

Home(/): links to /managers and to /departments
Managers: 
    - /managers   
    - /managers/:managerID
Depatments: 
    - /departments  
    - /departments/:departmentID
